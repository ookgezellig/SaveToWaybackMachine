This improved Wayback Machine Internet Archive archiving script has three modes:
1) It can save a page/document to the Wayback Machine (WBM) of the Internet Archive (IA)
2) It can retrieve the latest/newest archived version of a page from the WBM
3) It can retrieve the oldest/first archived version of a page from the WBM

In : URL of page e.g. https://www.kb.nl/annemarie-mol-geillustreerde-bibliografie
Out: URL to WBM snapshot: e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/DATETIMESTAMP/https://www.kb.nl/annemarie-mol-geillustreerde-bibliografie

The URLs to be processed are read from a .txt file, with 1 URL per line

The scripts uses https://pypi.org/project/waybackpy/ + https://github.com/akamhy/waybackpy/wiki/Python-package-docs

Notes:
27/11/2021:
* When archiving/saving pages (mode 1) : script seem to run rather stable due to improved error handling
* When archiving/saving pages (mode 1): script runs rather slow  (pm 3 minutes for 10 urls), this seems to be due to the
  processing speed of the WBM.
