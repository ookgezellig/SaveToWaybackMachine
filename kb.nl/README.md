## UPDATEN!!!
Paar screenshotjes van kb.nl pagna;s invoegen

The file [allekbnlurls_voorarchivering_14122021.xlsx](allekbnlurls_voorarchivering_14122021.xlsx) contains some 5.700 URLs of pages in the [KB website](https://www.kb.nl) (kb.nl) as retrieved from the site (on 30-11-2021). 

As this entire site will be repleced with a new one during early 2022, these pages are in danger of disappearing from the web. Therefore, these pages/URLs need archiving into the Wayback Machine (WBM) of the Internet Archive. 

The Excel has 2 sheets: 
1) *kb.nl_alrecentgearchiveerd* : 4.371 pages from kb.nl that were recently archived (mostly during Nov + Dec 2021), either 'spontaneously' by the crawler of the WBM, or in the first run of the [wbm-archiver_v2_30112021](../wbm-archiver_v2_30112021) script in early december.
2) *kb.nl_nogtearchiveren* : 1.349 pages that have not been recently archived, or have not been archived ever at all. In December 2021 the KB will archive these pages actively using following runs of that script.
In that folder, the [url-inputlist.txt](../wbm-archiver_v2_30112021/url-inputlist.txt) contains the exact same URLs as are in the *kb.nl_nogtearchiveren* sheet in the Excel.
