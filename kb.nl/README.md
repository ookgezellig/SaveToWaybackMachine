# Saving kb.nl to the Wayback Machine
*Latest update: 28-12-2021*

Kb.nl, the [website](https://www.kb.nl) of the KB, national library of the Netherlands, is periodically actively copied to the Wayback Machine, ie. the KB takes the initiative to copy (parts of) kb.nl into the WBM. In addition, kb.nl is also passively archived, the WBM crawler archives kb.nl pages without active involvement of the KB. 

## WBM archive run december 2021
As kb.nl will be replaced with a new website in Q1 2022, the pages of the old website were in danger of disappearing from the web. Therefore, during december 2021, the KB has archived the website into the WBM.

* The file *[urls_kbnl_archivedwbm_24122021.csv](24122021/urls_kbnl_archivedwbm_24122021.csv)* contains 5.720 URLs/pages (as retrieved from the site on 30-11-2021) and their WBM archived versions, as captured during december 2021.  
* The file *[urls_kbnl_archivedwbm_24122021.xlsx](24122021/urls_kbnl_archivedwbm_24122021.xlsx)* is the Excel equivalent.

The archiving was done using the *[wbm-archiver_v2_30112021](../wbm-archiver_v2_30112021)* Python script.

## WBM archive run Q1 2022
As soon as the new kb.nl website will be live, expected for Q1 2022, the KB will actively archive it into the WBM.
