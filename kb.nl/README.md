The file [allekbnlurls_voorarchivering_30112021.xlsx](allekbnlurls_voorarchivering_30112021.xlsx) contains some 5700 URLs of pages in the [KB website](https://www.kb.nl) (kb.nl) as retrieved from the site on 30-11-2021. 

As this entire site will be repleced with a new one during early 2022, these pages are in danger of disappearing from the web. Therefore, these pages/URLs need archiving into the Wayback Machine (WBM) of the Internet Archive. 

The Excel has 2 sheets: 
1) *kb.nl_alrecentgearchiveerd* : 953 pages from kb.nl that were recently archived (mostly during Nov + Dec 2021) by the crawler of the WBM. Because there is a recent archive copy in the WBM, these pages do not need active archiving by the KB anymore.
2) *kb.nl_nogtearchiveren* : 4.767 pages that have not been recently archived, or have not been archived ever at all. In December 2021 the KB will archive these pages actively using the [wbm-archiver_v2_30112021](../wbm-archiver_v2_30112021) script.
