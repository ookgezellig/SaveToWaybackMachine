# Saving kb.nl to the Wayback Machine
*Latest update: 23-03-2022*

Kb.nl, the [website](https://www.kb.nl) of the KB, national library of the Netherlands, is periodically actively copied to the Wayback Machine, ie. the KB takes the initiative to copy (parts of) kb.nl into the WBM. In addition, kb.nl is also passively archived, the WBM crawler archives kb.nl pages without active involvement of the KB. 

## [WBM archive run March 2022](23032022/)
The [new kb.nl website](https://www.kb.nl) was launched on 20th March 2022. On the same date a new, dicated [KB special collections website](https://collecties.kb.nl) was launched. Both sites were actively archived it into the WBM on 23-24 March 2022, using the same scripts and approach as in the [December 2021 run](24122021/). 

## [WBM archive run December 2021](24122021/)
As kb.nl will be replaced with a new website in Q1 2022, the pages of the old website were in danger of disappearing from the web. Therefore, during december 2021, the KB has archived the website into the WBM.
